# Microservices Architecture

This document provides a detailed explanation of the microservices architecture used in OuiAI.

## Microservice Design Principles

OuiAI follows these key principles for microservice design:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on a specific business domain
2. **Autonomy**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **Resilience**: Services are designed to handle failures gracefully
4. **Decentralization**: Each service manages its own data
5. **Event-Driven**: Services communicate asynchronously via events when possible

## Service Boundaries

Service boundaries are defined by business domains:

### Gateway Service
- API routing and composition
- Authentication token validation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response logging
- CORS policy enforcement

### Identity Service
- User registration and authentication
- Profile management
- Role and permission management
- OAuth integration
- JWT token issuance

### Projects Service
- Project creation and lifecycle management
- Project categorization and tagging
- Project versioning
- Project collaboration

### Social Service
- User connections (follow/unfollow)
- Activity feed management
- Likes, comments, and shares
- Content moderation

### Notifications Service
- Event-based notification generation
- Notification delivery preferences
- Push notifications for mobile
- Email notifications

### Search Service
- Full-text search implementation
- Indexing of projects and user profiles
- Search relevance tuning
- Recommendation algorithms

## Inter-Service Communication

### Synchronous Communication (REST API)

Used for:
- User-initiated actions requiring immediate response
- Data retrieval operations
- Simple queries

Implementation:
- RESTful HTTP APIs
- JSON data format
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)

Used for:
- State change notifications
- Operations that don't require immediate response
- Cross-service data consistency

Implementation:
- Azure Service Bus Topics and Subscriptions
- Event schema versioning
- Dead-letter queue for failed messages

## Data Consistency

OuiAI implements eventual consistency between microservices:

1. **Local Transactions**: ACID transactions within each service's boundary
2. **Domain Events**: Services publish events when state changes
3. **Event Handlers**: Services subscribe to relevant events and update their state
4. **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures reliable message publishing

## Service Discovery

Services locate each other using:

1. **Azure Kubernetes Service DNS**: Service discovery within the Kubernetes cluster
2. **API Gateway**: Client-facing service discovery
3. **Configuration**: Service endpoints stored in configuration

## Resilience Patterns

OuiAI implements the following resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when a service is unavailable
2. **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retries failed requests
3. **Timeout**: Limits the time waiting for a response
4. **Bulkhead**: Isolates failures to specific components
5. **Fallback**: Provides alternative behavior when a service fails

## Monitoring and Observability

Each microservice implements:

1. **Distributed Tracing**: Traces requests across service boundaries
2. **Centralized Logging**: Aggregated logs for troubleshooting
3. **Health Checks**: Endpoints to verify service health
4. **Metrics Collection**: Performance and business metrics
5. **Alerting**: Notifications when services degrade

## Deployment and Scaling

Each microservice:
- Is packaged as a Docker container
- Has independent CI/CD pipelines
- Can be scaled horizontally based on demand
- Uses infrastructure as code for provisioning

## Data Isolation

Each microservice:
- Owns its domain-specific data
- Has a dedicated database or schema
- Implements data access through a repository pattern
- Uses Entity Framework Core for data access

## Security

Service-to-service security includes:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Service identity verification
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption in transit and at rest

## API Versioning

OuiAI implements API versioning to ensure backward compatibility:
- URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)
- API documentation for each version
- Deprecation policy for old versions
